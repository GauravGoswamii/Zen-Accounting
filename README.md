Project Launch: Zen Accounting – A Modern Banking Web App Prototype
After a focused month of development, I’m excited to share my latest full-stack project — Zen Accounting 🧾💚

This web app is a simple yet powerful banking-style prototype, where users can:
 🔐 Register & log in
 🏦 Create multiple accounts
 💸 Deposit, withdraw, and transfer money
 🛡️ Stay secure with JWT authentication and bcrypt encryption
 🎨 Experience a sleek, modern UI — inspired by the Spotify login page, designed with a beautiful fresh green theme 🌿

Functionality:
Frontend: React + Vite + Tailwind CSS
Backend: Node.js + Express + MongoDB
Security: JWT, bcrypt (yes, not even I can see your password 😌)

It’s a slick, elegant, and modern UI experience — one that I’m truly proud of,
 I hope, maybe it could sparkle up your eyes ✨
